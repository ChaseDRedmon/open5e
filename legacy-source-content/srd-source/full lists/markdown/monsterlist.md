### Hags
#### Green Hag
Medium fey, neutral evil

**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 82 (11d8 + 33)

**Speed** 30 ft.

STR    | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA
------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------
1 (+4) | 12 (+1) | 16 (+3) | 13 (+1) | 14 (+2) | 14 (+2)

**Skills** Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14;

**Languages** Common, Draconic, Sylvan;

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**Amphibious**: The hag can breathe air and water. **Innate Spellcasting**: The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: **At will**: _dancing lights_, _minor illusion_, _vicious mockery_ **Mimicry**: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Actions

**Claws**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. **Illusory Appearance**: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.  The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised. **Invisible Passage**: The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

#### Night Hag
Medium fiend, neutral evil

**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 112 (15d8 + 45)

**Speed** 30 ft.

STR    | DEX     | CON     | INT     | WIS     | CHA

**Condition Immunities** charmed

**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16;

**Languages** Abyssal, Common, Infernal, Primordial;

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)

**Innate Spellcasting**: The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: **At will**: _detect magic_, _magic missile_ **2/day each**: _plane shift_ (self only), _ray of enfeeblement_, _sleep_

**Magic Resistance**: The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions

**Claws (Hag Form Only)**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage. **Change Shape**: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies. **Etherealness**: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a _heartstone_ in her possession. **Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)**: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A _protection from evil and good_ spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a _magic circle_. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's _soul bag_. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until removed by the _greater restoration_ spell or similar magic.

#### Sea Hag
Medium fey, chaotic evil

**Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 52 (7d8 + 21)

**Speed** 30 ft., swim 40 ft.

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**Amphibious**: The hag can breathe air and water. **Horrific Appearance**: Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.  Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag.

Actions

**Claws**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit_: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. **Death Glare**: The hag targets one frightened creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points. **Illusory Appearance**: The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.  The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.

The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.  While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.  The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it at a time. **Transparent**: Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has neither moved nor attacked.

On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.  An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

Actions

**Multiattack**: The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. **Swallow**: The tarrasque makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of the tarrasque's turns.  If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

Legendary Actions

**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 17;

**Languages** the languages it knew in life;

**Challenge** 13 (10,000 XP)

**Shapechanger**: If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into its true form.  While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it dies.  While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it takes from sunlight. **Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. **Misty Escape**: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.  While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point. **Regeneration**: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn. **Spider Climb**: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. **Vampire Weaknesses**: The vampire has the following flaws: **Forbiddance**: The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
<!-- -->

**Harmed by Running Water**: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
<!-- -->

**Stake to the Heart**: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed.
<!-- -->

**Sunlight Hypersensitivity**: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Actions

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)**: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack. **Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only)**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit_: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18). **Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only)**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by the vampire, incapacitated, or restrained. _Hit:_ 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control. **Charm**: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack.  Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. **Children of the Night (1/Day)**: The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
